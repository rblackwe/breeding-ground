<h1>DOM Image Annotation</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>, the online photo 
organiser application, has some very neat tricks up its sleeve.
Perhaps the neatest is its process of annotating an image by
highlighting specific areas of that image and attaching notes
to them. Very neat. It's done with a combination of DHTML and Flash
stuff. Gina at scribbling.net has put together an 
<a href="http://scribbling.net/dhtml-image-annotation">example of how to
do something similar using DHTML</a>. However, her outlined approach,
while nice, requires you to build a special rollover image with the
annotated areas clearly highlighted, and it uses <code>onmouseover</code>
and <code>onmouseout</code> attributes on lots of bits of the code. While
this works, it's not really following the 
<a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/aqlists/">principles of
unobtrusive DHTML</a> that make a script easy to implement. Perhaps we
can slightly improve upon it.</p>
<h2>Image maps</h2>
<p>Gina did hit upon the key point, though: marking out various bits 
of an image has been possible in HTML for <em>ages</em>, using a
client-side image map. We've moved away from them to a certain extent
these days (well, the CSS-and-web-standards lobby have; they seem to be
a mainstay of graphics-heavy commercial table-driven sites still), but
they're specifically designed for this purpose. Just to refresh your
memory (if such a refresher is needed), this is how an image map works:</p>
<p>The image tag can take a <code>usemap</code> attribute, like so:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;img src="myimg.png" alt="My image" <strong>usemap="#mapname"</strong>&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>usemap</code> attribute points to a map which 
demarcates parts of the image:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;map name="imgmap"&gt;
  &lt;area alt="" title="Buffy mug" nohref="nohref"
        shape="rect" coords="170,150,210,180"&gt;
  &lt;area alt="" title="Crap books" nohref="nohref"
        shape="rect" coords="170,10,320,80"&gt;
&lt;/map&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>name</code> of the <code>&lt;map&gt;</code> is the
same name as that in the <code>usemap</code> attribute of the original
<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, except that the <code>usemap</code> takes a 
preceding # symbol.</p>
<p>Each <code>&lt;map&gt;</code> is composed of <code>area</code>s, which 
have <code>coords</code> and a <code>shape</code>. While <code>shape</code>
can be esoteric things like <code>circle</code> and <code>poly</code>, we'll
concern ourselves only with rectangular <code>area</code>s here, which have
a <code>shape</code> of <code>rect</code>. The <code>coords</code> attribute
takes four numbers, comma-separated: <code>coords="l,t,r,b"</code>, where
the four numbers are <strong>left</strong>, <strong>top</strong>,
<strong>right</strong>, and <strong>bottom</strong>: pixel positions,
measured relative to the top-left of the image. Note that this is
<em>not</em> CSS: these are not in the CSS top-right-bottom-left order!
There are plenty of resources out there on the web about setting up
image maps, and indeed programs specifically to construct them given
an image.</p>
<p>So, what we want is to have those <code>area</code>s appear on an image
when we mouse over it.</p>
<p>Like this, in fact:</p>

<p><img src="mydesk.jpg" usemap="#imgmap" class="annotated"></p>

<h2>How do we use it</h2>
<p>Much like all the other unobtrusive scripts, you don't need to
do very much to make this happen. You <em>do</em> need to embed the
<code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag in your page as normal, and construct an
image map and put that in the document too, as described above. Your 
image should also have a class of <code>annotated</code>.</p>
<p>Your <code>area</code>s <strong>must</strong> have a <code>title</code>
attribute which is the tooltip that you want to appear when mousing
over that area.</p>
<p>Then, download the <a href="annimg.js">JavaScript library</a> and
<a href="annimg.css">stylesheet</a> and include them in your page
as normal:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="<a href="annimg.js">annimg.js</a>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="<a href="annimg.css">annimg.css</a>"&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>and that's everything. All done.</p>

<h2>Nicer titles</h2>
Note that the tooltips that appear, associated with each area, are
ordinary browser tooltips generated from the <code>title</code> element.
While these are serviceable enough, you might want something a little
cleverer. The DOM Annotated Images script integrates nicely with my
<a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/nicetitle/">nicetitles</a>:
if the NiceTitles script is also included on the page (which it may
already be, if you're already using them) then the tooltips for the
image annotations will appear as NiceTitles.</p>

<h3>Updates to the script</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>2004-11-16</dt>
  <dd>Explicitly specify that the image must have class
<code>annotated</code>. Thanks to Jeff Gates.</dd>
  <dt>2004-11-09</dt>
  <dd>Updated to take account of text size changes (or other alterations to 
  the flow of the page) after initial load, so that the areas don't get 
  offset. Thanks to Mac Steve.</dd>
