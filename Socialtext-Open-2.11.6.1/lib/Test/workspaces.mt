Now, go to your dev server's Settings -> Create New Workspace.  First, check some error conditions: Hit 'Create' with nothing filled in.
...fill in workspace with a valid name, but keep Title blank
...fill in title, but give a short workspace name (2 chars)
...try an illegal workspace name, such as "admin"
...try a name that's illegal for mail alias reasons, such as "www-data"
...try a name with illegal chars, such as (*&)(*&#@)\$#
...ok, that'll probably do - give it a legal pair, such as Banana/banana, and click around on it a little

Ok, click around on a new workspace a bit to make sure it's legitimate, then go to Settings -> This Workspace
...probably change a bunch of things at once to save time: The workspace title, set the image to existing: http://www.google.com/images/firefox/light.gif , the Team Favorites page, etc - just change 'em all and make sure that when you Save they're the same - it's up to other parts of the code to correctly respond to these options.
...notice that the Proxy only accepts input if it's in the form of https://... this should probably generate a warning, but currently doesn't.
...then check the error handling, maybe delete the workspace name. (which also doesn't seem to be getting validation at the moment)
...maybe test the image upload facility.
