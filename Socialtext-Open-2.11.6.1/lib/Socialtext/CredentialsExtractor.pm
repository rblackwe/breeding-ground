Socialtext::CredentialsExtractor - a pluggable mechanism for extracting
credentials from a Request

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Socialtext::CredentialsExtractor;

  my $extractors = Socialtext::CredentialsExtractor->Extractors;
  my $credentials;

  while ( my $extractor = $extractors->next ) {

    $credentials = $extractor->extract_credentials( $request );

    ...
  }

  die "No creds, can't do anything" if !$credentials;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides a hook point for registering new means of gathering
credentials from a request object. 

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Socialtext::CredentialsExtractor->Extractors

Returns an iterable object comprising all the registered plugins in order of
their configuration (found as a setting in C<Socialtext::AppConfig>.
