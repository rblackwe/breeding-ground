=head1 NAME

Socialtext::Hostname - Provides the local machine's host and domain names

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Perhaps a little code snippet.

  use Socialtext::Hostname;

  my $fqdn = Socialtext::Hostname::fqdn();
  my $host = Socialtext::Hostname::hostname();
  my $domain = Socialtext::Hostname::domain();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a few functions for determining the local
machine's host and domain names.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

This module provides the following functions:

=head2 hostname()

Always returns the short version of the machine's hostname (without a
domain name).

=head2 fqdn()

Returns the machine's fully-qualified domain name (hostname plus
domain name).

=head2 domain()

Returns just the machine's domain name.

=head1 SEE ALSO

Sys::Hostname - this basically returns whatever is in
F</etc/hostname>, which could be fully-qualified or not.

Sys::Hostname::FQDN - It's a lot of code to do very little, and
pointlessly includes an XS reimplementation of Sys::Hostname.
