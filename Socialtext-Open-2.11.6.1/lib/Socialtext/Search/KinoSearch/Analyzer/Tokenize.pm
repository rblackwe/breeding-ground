# KinoSearch stores tokens by storing the original string once and then
# referencing tokens within that string through a list of start/end offset
# pairs.
#
# For example: Assume our string is "foo-bar", which contains two tokens "foo"
# and "bar".  Then KinoSearch stores "foo-bar" and a then two start/end offset
# pairs:  [0,2] (for "foo") and [4,6] (for "bar").
#
# While this approach is fine it causes a problem in that KinoSearch does not
# correctly understand UTF-8.  Those start/end offsets are treated as *byte*
# offsets in the original string, not character offsets.  This causes some
# problems in that multi-byte characters screw up tokenization.
#
# The workaround is to create a function, _bytes_pos, which acts like
# bytes::pos() would if it existed.  That is, it is a byte oriented version of
# the Perl builtin pos() function.   
#
# We also make use of an optimization that assumes _bytes_pos() is always
# called with pos() increasing monotonically.  This is a safe assumption
# because of how our algorithim in analyze() calls _bytes_pos().  The
# optimization lets us reuse previous calls to _bytes_pos() to avoid
# recomputing byte counts.  In practice this means a 4.3 MB chunk of text is
# indexed in 16 seconds instead of 20 minutes on standard 2006 Socialtext
# DevHardware.
#
# The optimization manifests itself through the use of $last_byte and
# $last_pos which remember the last byte returned and the character position
# that byte belongs to.  reset_pos() can be used to reset these private
# counters.

        return $last_byte if $last_pos == $pos;

        # This function is specifically optimized for a monotonically
        # increasing $pos.  Die if we're giving a $pos less than $last_pos
        die "Error: bytes_pos $pos < $last_pos\n" if $pos < $last_pos;

        # Find the number of bytes in $$string_ref up to $pos.  The basic idea
        # here is to count the number of bytes in the substring between the
        # start of the string and pos().  The answer is the bytes equivalent
        # of pos().
        #
        # Our optimization make use of the fact that pos() increases
        # monotonically, and thus only grabs the substring between the
        # previous call, $last_pos, up to pos() which is $pos - $last_pos.
        # The bytes in that string are then added to a private counter, which
        # is reused on the next call.  Likewise $pos is saved in $last_pos for
        # use on the next call.
