=head1 NAME

Socialtext::Search::Hit - Representation of a search hit in a wiki object.

particular types of hits (e.g., a hit found in a wiki page, or an attachment)
should present.

package Socialtext::Search::Hit;

# "use base" freaks out if this package is empty, so...
sub _totally_bogus_method { }

# No code goes here yet.  If anything ever emerges which is obviously common
# to all Hit interfaces, it should go here.
