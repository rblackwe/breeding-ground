# REVIEW: Why are we picking the first element in the results?
# In the earlier versions of this code, pages lists were generated
# with pages->all_ids_newest_first(), which had the most recently
# modified page at the top of the list. A collection's modified
# time is the most recently modified time of all the resources.
# The following code is no longer true, as we only sort by newest
# when query parameter order is set to newest, so we need to make
# a change here. One option is to traverse the list in this method,
# but we likely already did that somewhere else, so why do it again?
sub last_modified { @$_[1] ? $_[1]->[0]->{modified_time} : time }

# REVIEW: This need to be different depending on the query?
sub collection_name {
    'Pages from ' . $_[0]->workspace->title;
}

# REVIEW: 'pages/' is required here because we are not inside 'pages/'
# when this class responds. We are at pages, meaning we are inside the
# workspace. Using / on the end of the map in uri_map does not get
# the desired results, and are they even desired?
