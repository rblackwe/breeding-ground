# quick hack based on the one liners we were playing with

# take an ip number
# find all the ports that that ip number is coming in on
# use them to get a list of pids
# strace the pid (note being in read is not bad, it could be normally idle)
# look in the logs for that pid's activity

# you have to hit ctrl-c to get out of the strace
# you have to hit return to dismiss the egrep output and move on to text pid


IP=$1
LOG=/var/log/apache-perl/nlw-access.log

for i in \
  `netstat -nt|grep $IP|awk '{print $5}'|awk -F: '{print $2}'` ; do
    PID=`sudo lsof -i:$i |grep -v PID|awk '{print $2}'`
    echo $PID || exit
    sudo strace -p $PID
    sudo gdb -p $PID
    egrep " $PID [0-9]$" $LOG
