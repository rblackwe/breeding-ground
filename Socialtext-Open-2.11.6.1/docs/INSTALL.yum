INSTALL.yum -- Installing dependencies with Yum

Copyright (C) 2004-2006 by Socialtext, Inc.

== OVERVIEW ==

Yum is an automated package manager for Fedora, RedHat, CentOS and other
related Linux distributions.  Using yum as your package installer will
make the installation of the Socialtext software much easier.

== Adding repositories ==

The base CentOS repositories used by yum are pretty small.  The Dag Yum
repository contains many more Perl modules.  To tell yum to use Dag,
create the file /etc/yum.repos.d/dag.repo with the following contents:

    [dag]
    Name=Dag RPM Repository for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
    baseurl=http://apt.sw.be/redhat/el4/en/i386/dag
    gpgcheck=1
    enabled=1
    gpgkey=http://dag.wieers.com/packages/RPM-GPG-KEY.dag.txt

Then, install the packages listed in build/pkg-lists/yum.

== Errors ==

I've run into problems with yum complaining that rtld(GNU_HASH) is not
installed.  Apparently the solution to this is to update glibc and the
entire toolchain, which is hardly a simple task.

Fortunately, this should only show up if you've enabled the
fedora-development or fedora-extras-development repositories:
