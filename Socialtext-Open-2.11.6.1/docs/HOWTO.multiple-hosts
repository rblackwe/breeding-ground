HOWTO.multiple-hosts -- How to have multiple hosts in Apache

Copyright (C) 2004-2006 by Socialtext, Inc.

Socialtext Open is designed to behave nicely with an Apache configuration that includes other hosts.
Here's how to do that.

== Single-host Apache setup

The simplest way to set up Socialtext Open is the default, where you
use /etc/init.d/st-apache for starting the Apache daemon.  st-apache
loads /etc/apache-perl/st-httpd.conf, which in turn <Include>s
/etc/apache-perl/auto-generated.d/nlw.conf.

The st-httpd.conf contains the high-level Apache configuration items,
like what port to use, MIME types, etc.  There is nothing related to
hosts in it.

The host information, including hostnames, paths to handle, etc, are
all in the nlw.conf.  (The name "nlw.conf" is a remnant from Socialtext
Open's earliest incarnations as "Nice Little Wiki".)

== Multiple-host Apache setup

All you need to do to get a Socialtext host co-existing with your other
virtual hosts is to include it from your main httpd.conf.

    Include /etc/apache-perl/auto-generated.d/nlw.conf

Make sure that you don't edit any of the values in nlw.conf, since they
will be overwritten next time you do a Socialtext Open upgrade.
