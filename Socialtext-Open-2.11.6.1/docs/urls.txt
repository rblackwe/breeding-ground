This document is to serve as master documentation of the semantics of all the
URLs that we serve anywhere.  This should include, eventually, even special
URLs for serving static content more quickly overseas, etc.  Those URLs
peculiar to specific customer installations should probably be documented in
separate file(s).

The layout is described in the file outline.txt.

1. The character '*' serves as a wildcard as in the shell.  '?' does not.

2. Synonymous URLs can be separated by a space.  A literal space should be
   percent-escaped (%20).

3. Any word in all caps is considered a placeholder, not a literal.

4. If a given http method is not specified, then the expected behaviour is not
   defined.  Users should reasonably expect to receive an HTTP error code when
   they hit that URL with that method.

  - /

        - FIXME: flesh out recent changes
      - FIXME: other stuff under /WORKSPACE
