INSTALL.ceqlotron -- How to install Socialtext's ceqlotron

=== The Ceqlotron ===

In addition to the Apache part of Socialtext, the ceqlotron runs in the
background to do background change maintenance.  When a page changes, it
must be reindexed, and that's handled by the ceqlotron.

You can see the status of the ceqlotron's queue with the ceq-stat
program:

    $ ceq-stat
    Changes in queue:
      Attachment      2
      Page           14
      Workspace       0

      TOTAL          16

When you first install Socialtext, the Help workspace must get
indexed.  When the ceqlotron fires up the first time, it will
immediately get working on the Help workspace.  After a minute or
two, depending on your machine speed, the queue will clear out.
You can monitor it with the ceq-stat program.

If you prefer to not have the ceqlotron running continuously in the
background, it can be run as a cron job with the --once flag, to tell
it to run through the queue once, and --foreground, to not spawn any
background children.

    # Crontab line for running the ceqlotron hourly at xx:17
    17 * * * * ceqlotron --once --foreground

If you use the cron method, make sure to use /etc/init.d/st-apache to
start Apache, instead of /etc/init.d/socialtext which also starts up
the ceqlotron.
