=== Email support ===

Socialtext Open supports email both inbound and outbound.  Besides having
the wiki able to send email notifications, you can create pages by
mailing to the wiki.  In order for this to happen, your email aliases
file needs to have aliases for each workspace:

    admin: "|/usr/local/bin/st-admin deliver-email --workspace admin"
    sales: "|/usr/local/bin/st-admin deliver-email --workspace sales"
    dev: "|/usr/local/bin/st-admin deliver-email --workspace dev"

Socialtext Open will add lines to your aliases file when workspaces are
created if the aliases file is called "aliases.deliver", and it resides
in /etc or your /etc/socialtext directory.  Otherwise, you'll need to
create an alias line by hand.
