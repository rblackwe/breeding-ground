INSTALL.dependencies -- Installing Socialtext's dependencies

=== Optional helper programs ===

The Socialtext indexer can take advantage of external programs to
enable file attachments to be indexed.  For example, with the program
wvText installed, Socialtext can index your Microsoft Word file
attachments.  The configure program will let you know if there are
any of these you can install.  You can also run the
build/bin/check-optional-tools.

=== Optional CPAN Dependencies ===

Socialtext Open uses the Perl bindings to the ImageMagick to resize
uploaded logos. If you do not have ImageMagick and its Perl bindings
installed, you can still upload logos, but they will not be resized.

Socialtext Open uses the Apache::SizeLimit module to kill apache+mod_perl
processes that grow too large, because searching a very large wiki 
can cause the process to grow quite large. Since Apache::SizeLimit 
does not work on all platforms, this dependency is optional.

=== CPAN Dependencies ===

./configure will tell you if you're missing any prerequistes (and trust
me, you are).  Since CPAN.pm (and by extension, the CPAN) doesn't
always deal with dependency management nicely it might take you a
few cycles to get everything installed.  The best advice I can offer
is to try and install the prebuilt packages for your OS if you can't
get a particular CPAN module to install.  Some packages may need
to be force installed because they have harmless failing tests.

If you're using Debian or Ubuntu, we have packages created for these
dependencies.  For details, see docs/INSTALL.apt-get.  It will make your
life much easier.

The ./configure will prompt you to install missing dependencies
from CPAN, unfortunately not all of our dependencies are available
from Dapper.  The CPAN modules won't ask lots of questions, mostly
you will just be prompted if as to whether or not you want to install
dependencies of other packages.  Always select yes.

The only module which asks you any questions that you should pay
attention to is Alzabo.  Pick /var/lib/alzabo as the Alzabo root,
unless you need it in another location.  If so, you'll need to
update nlw.conf as well.  Choose no to MySQL support (unless you
want MySQL support) and make sure to choose yes to Postgresql
support.  It's safe to not run the tests against the Postgres DB,
so skip the tests unless you have Postgres running and a user setup
to use.

== CPAN dependencies that fail ==

Not all the CPAN modules will pass their tests.

XML::Atom claims that XML::XPath and XML::LibXML are optional, but
it won't install without them.  You may also have to install
XML::LibXML before XML::Atom, instead of letting the XML::Atom
install it by itself.

Eventually, after a lot of bouncing on the Enter key, you will reach a
fixed point.  Some subset of the dependencies will fail to install and
you'll keep ending back up at a menu that looks like this:

    The following modules are missing, or you may have older versions:

      SOAP::Lite 0.67
      XML::Atom 0.22
      XML::Feed 0.05
      REST::Application 0.94

    Install these missing dependencies from CPAN [y]?

SOAP::Lite is particularly troublesome in that the current version (0.69) 
will not install (the tests don't pass).  To install the correct version of SOAP::Lite, you can do the following:

sudo cpan -i B/BY/BYRNE/SOAP/SOAP-Lite-0.67.tar.gz

The exact list of modules may change, but the list should be relatively short
and you'll reach this point after having installed lots of other modules.
These are modules which failed to pass their tests or in some way blew up on
install.  We'll have to force install them, but again, your exact list may
differ.   For example:

    sudo cpan
    cpan> force install Name::Of::Module::You::Are::Forcing

Repeat for each module.  Hopefully, without too much trouble you'll be able to
push through to the other side continue with the main install.  Once the
dependencies are installed Makefile.PL be runnable without throwing any
warnings.  Continue to "make" and "sudo make install".

You'll want to make sure Postgres is configured for access as mentioned above,
otherwise the install will fail.
