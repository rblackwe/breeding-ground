Socialtext Open is available to users free of charge, and accordingly
comes with no specific promises of support. That being said, there are
a number of ways to get answers to questions about Socialtext.

Creating a page on the Socialtext Open Source wiki is a great way to
make your problem or question known and invite discussion and help. The
discussion about the problem will become part of the body of the
workspace, the wiki way.

The Socialtext Open mailing lists and Socialtext Open forums are another
place to send your questions or problems, whether with installation,
running Socialtext Open, or any other problem. The lists and forums are

== Asking questions

When asking questions, you can help get better and faster answers by
giving information that's as complete as possible. Include as much
information about your situation as possible. For example, include:

    * Version of Socialtext Open you're using
    * Distribution of Linux/UNIX you're running on
    * What versions of Perl and Apache you're using
    * Version of your MTA (Sendmail, Qmail, etc) if it's mail-related
    * How you ran configure, and the output it generated
    * Any changes made to your /etc/socialtext/socialtext.conf file
    * Full text of errors received on screen
    * Relevant entries from your Apache error.log file

Then include narrative about the problem. Tell what you did and how you
got to where you are.  Sample query

Here's a posting that lays out plenty of information that helps the
reader understand the problem, and how you got there.

    Hi, I'm having trouble installing Socialtext Open 2.5.1.4. I'm
    running RedHat Enterprise 6.2, Apache 1.3.23 and Perl 5.8.8.

    My problem is accessing the front page. I ran configure and make
    and make install, and everything seems to install correctly. I
    was able to start up apache-perl and the ceqlotron via the
    /etc/init.d scripts, and I see via ps that they're running. However,
    when I try to go to http://wiki.mysite.com, it redirects me to
    adsl-203-312-23-1.myisp.com, which is the hostname assigned by my
    DSL provider. I looked in /var/log/apache-perl/error-log but didn't
    see any errors.

This lets the reader say "A-ha, it sounds like you didn't specify
--hostname=wiki.mysite.com when running configure." If the poster had
included the output of configure as well, it would have been verifiable,
too.
