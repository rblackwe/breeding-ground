INSTALL.apache-perl -- How to install Apache 1 + mod_perl

Copyright (C) 2004-2006 by Socialtext, Inc.

Some Linux distributions do not have packages for Apache and mod_perl.
Here are the directions to build an apache-perl for running Socialtext.

== Download Apache

As of this writing, the latest/greatest is 1.3.37.

    http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi

== Download mod_perl

As of this writing, the latest/greatest is 1.29.  Download it from:

    http://perl.apache.org/download/

The direct download link is:

    http://perl.apache.org/dist/mod_perl-1.0-current.tar.gz

== Unpack Apache and mod_perl

Unpack the tarballs in parallel directories. In this example I'll use
/usr/src.

    $ cd /usr/src
    $ tar zxvf apache_1.3.37.tar.gz
    $ tar zxvf mod_perl-1.0-current.tar.gz


== Configure Apache

Run the configure program on the Apache directory, but don't run make yet.
The options below include as few options as possible into the Apache.

    $ cd apache_1.3.37
    $ ./configure \
        --prefix=/usr/local/apache-perl \
        --target=apache-perl \
        --with-perl=/usr/bin/perl \
        --libexecdir=/usr/lib/apache-perl \
        --logfiledir=/var/log/apache-perl \
        --bindir=/usr/bin \
        --sbindir=/usr/sbin \
        --sysconfdir=/etc/apache-perl \
        \
        --activate-module=src/modules/perl/libperl.a \
        \
        --disable-module=auth_db \
        --disable-module=autoindex \
        --disable-module=cgi \
        \
        --enable-module=expires \
        --enable-module=rewrite \
        --enable-module=headers \
        \
        --enable-shared=access \
        --enable-shared=alias \
        --enable-shared=auth \
        --enable-shared=dir \
        --enable-shared=expires \
        --enable-shared=headers \
        --enable-shared=log_config \
        --enable-shared=mime \
        --enable-shared=mime_magic \
        --enable-shared=negotiation \
        --enable-shared=rewrite \
        --enable-shared=setenvif \
        --enable-shared=status \

Configure will generate a lot of output, but don't run make yet.

== Configure & build mod_perl

This builds and installs mod_perl both in the Perl lib tree and in the Apache build tree.

    $ cd ../mod_perl-1.29
    $ perl Makefile.PL \
        APACHE_SRC=../apache_1.3.37/src \
        NO_HTTPD=1 \
        USE_APACI=1 \
        PREP_HTTPD=1 \
        EVERYTHING=1 \

    ... lots of output ...

    $ make
    $ make test # or just skip it!
    $ sudo make install

== Reconfigure and build Apache

Now that mod_perl has been built and installed, and put its built module
in the Apache directory, rerun the configure, make and install.

    $ cd ../apache_1.3.37
    $ # redo configure from two steps back

Again, you'll get tons of output.  Now that that's done, run make and
install it.

    $ make
    $ sudo make install

== Build Apache::Request

The Apache::Request module comes with a binary module that is notoriously
difficult to get to build correctly under the CPAN shell.  You might as
well build it by hand here while you're at it.

To do this build, you have to have gcc's c++ installed.

Get the tarball from:

    http://search.cpan.org/dist/libapreq/

The latest version as of this writing is:

    http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/S/ST/STAS/libapreq-1.33.tar.gz

Download it and unpack it into /usr/src:

    $ cd /usr/src
    $ wget ......tar.gz
    $ tar zxvf .....tar.gz
    $ cd libapreq-1.33
    $ ./configure
    $ make

If make can't find the location of the Apache header files (httpd.h etc),
you may need to rerun configure with the location of the header files:

    $ ./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/apache-perl/include
    $ make

Finally, install it.

    $ sudo make install


== Create www-data user

All of Socialtext's scripts are based on having the apache-perl run as
the user "www-data".  If this user doesn't exist, create it.  If possible,
give it a UID lower than 500, or however your distro numbers non-human
accounts.

== Make apache-perl automatically start

The important thing to remember is that apache-perl needs to run
all the time, as a service.  So does your Apache2 proxy if you're
using the dual-Apache proxy setup.

== You're done

You now have an Apache 1.3 installation with mod_perl built in, ready
for running Socialtext.
