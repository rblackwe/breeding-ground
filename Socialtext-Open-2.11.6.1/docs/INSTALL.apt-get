INSTALL.apt-get -- Instructions for using the Socialtext apt repository

Copyright (C) 2004-2006 by Socialtext, Inc.

Socialtext Open has dependencies on over 150 different Perl modules,
and not all of them are packaged by the Debian or Ubuntu projects.
We've created a repository of packages to help speed installation.

This document is not a tutorial on using apt-get.  It just covers
how to use Socialtext's repository with apt-get.

=== Add the repository to sources.list ===

Your Debian or Ubuntu system has a list of repositories it checks
for packages in the file /etc/apt-get/sources.list.  Add the following
line to your sources.list file:

    deb http://open.socialtext.net/apt socialtext-open main

This tells your apt-get to check our repository for distributions

=== Test that you're checking the repo ===

Now run "apt-get update" to verify that your apt-get is checking our repo.

    $ apt-get update
    Get: 1 http://open.socialtext.net socialtext-open Release.gpg [189B]
    Get: 2 http://security.ubuntu.com dapper-security Release.gpg [189B]
    ...
    W: GPG error: http://open.socialtext.net socialtext-open Release: \
      The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public \
      key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 291AC87373B9F51C
    ...

That line with the GPG error is a good thing.  (It may also not be
the last line of output) You shouldn't yet have our public keys,
so it shows that you're correctly checking our repository.

=== Install our keyring ===

Fetch and install the keyring for verifying future installs.  Of
course, some of the numbers and dates will be different, but the
output should look roughly like this.

    $ sudo apt-get install socialtext-keyring
    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree... Done
    The following NEW packages will be installed
      socialtext-keyring
    0 upgraded, 1 newly installed, 0 to remove and 15 not upgraded.
    Need to get 3282B of archives.
    After unpacking 49.2kB of additional disk space will be used.
    WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!
      socialtext-keyring
    Install these packages without verification [y/N]?

It's a bit of a catch-22, that you can't verify the install of the
keyring because you don't have a keyring.  You'll need to answer
"y" to continue:

    Get: 1 http://open.socialtext.net socialtext-open/main socialtext-keyring 20060901-1 [3282B]
    Fetched 3282B in 0s (13.4kB/s)
    Selecting previously deselected package socialtext-keyring.
    (Reading database ... 95307 files and directories currently installed.)
    Unpacking socialtext-keyring (from .../socialtext-keyring_20060901-1_all.deb) ...
    Setting up socialtext-keyring (20060901-1) ...
    OK

Finally, update the package lists one last time.

    $ apt-get update

=== Installing Socialtext Open's Perl dependencies ===

Once you've got the keyring set up, installing dependencies is simple:

    $ sudo apt-get install st-perl-deps
    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree... Done
    The following extra packages will be installed:
      libalzabo-perl libapache-reload-perl libapache-request-perl
      ...
      ...
    0 upgraded, 121 newly installed, 0 to remove and 1 not upgraded.
    Need to get 6411kB of archives.
    After unpacking 31.3MB of additional disk space will be used.
    Do you want to continue [Y/n]?

Answer "Y" and let your machine crank for a few minutes.  When it's done,
you should be ready for running configure on your Socialtext Open install
as described in the main INSTALL document.


=== Install individual distributions ===

You're now set to install new distributions.  If you want to install,
say, SOAP::Lite, a particularly odious module to install, do so
like this:

    $ sudo apt-get install libsoap-lite-perl
    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree... Done
    Recommended packages:
      libnet-jabber-perl
    The following packages will be upgraded:
      libsoap-lite-perl
    1 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 14 not upgraded.
    Need to get 0B/400kB of archives.
    After unpacking 4096B of additional disk space will be used.
    (Reading database ... 95312 files and directories currently installed.)
    Preparing to replace libsoap-lite-perl 0.66-2 (using .../libsoap-lite-perl_0.68-2_all.deb) ...
    Unpacking replacement libsoap-lite-perl ...
    Setting up libsoap-lite-perl (0.68-2) ...

Takes a few seconds to install the package, rather than a couple
of minutes to download, configure, build, test and install the
package from Perl's CPAN.

=== Ubuntu Dapper and Breezy ===

Dapper and Breezy (both with packages from Universe) include a number of
packages which can make installing Socialtext easier.  To make sure you have
Universe packages enabled, add or uncomment these lines in your
/etc/apt/sources.list file (change dapper to breezy if appropriate):

    deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu dapper universe
    deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu dapper universe

Once you have Universe in your sources.list run the following command first:

    # Use build/pkg-lists/breezy if you're running Breezy
    sudo apt-get install `cat build/pkg-lists/dapper`

As always please review the packages to be installed before continuing.
As the install proceeds you'll get warnings about apache-perl and
postgresql-7.4 or postgres-8.0.  These can both be ignored for now.
When the install is done it will say apache-perl failed to install.
Run this:

    sudo apt-get install apache-perl

It will try to configure apache-perl again and should succeed this time.  Once
that is done you can proceed with the normal Perl install.  However, before
you install the software system wide make sure that you've got Postgres
configured so the Apache user can connect as "nlw" to the "NLW" database, see
the section on Postgres above.

If you don't want to install all of our suggested packages and would rather
pull most things from CPAN then just install the following:

    perl
    perl-modules
    perl-doc
    apache-dev
    apache-perl
    postgresql
    build-essential

These packages will get you the three most important things: Perl,
Apache with mod_perl, and Postgres.  build-essential is helpful so you
can compile the various things that need building from CPAN.

You may also consider installing the "imagemagick" and "perlmagick"
package as well.  These are the ImageMagick image manipulation
programs, and the Perl bindings to them, respectively.  Installing
ImageMagick and the Perl bindings manually can be somewhat tricky,
so using the package is the way to go.
