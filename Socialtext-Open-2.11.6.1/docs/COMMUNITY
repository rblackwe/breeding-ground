Socialtext Open is open source, and that means more than just some
freely downloadable bits.  We're building a community of Socialtext
users, and we want you to be part of it.

The center of our community is, naturally, a Socialtext wiki
workspace, called "stoss", for "Socialtext Open Source Software".

    https://www.socialtext.net/stoss

This workspace is fully open to anyone who registers. Check the blogs
of Socialtext developers, ask questions, and follow development.

When you register, make a profile with some information about yourself,
and your projects and interests. You can create your own Socialtext blog
on stoss to describe ongoing development projects.

If you prefer mailing lists, we've got those, too:

If you have other questions about Socialtext Open, you can also
contact Andy Lester at andy.lester [at] socialtext.com.
