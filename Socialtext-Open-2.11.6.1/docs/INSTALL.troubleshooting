INSTALL.troubleshooting -- Troubleshooting installation

=== I just get a "server error" ===

Common things to check:

* Check your apache-perl error logs

* Make sure apache-perl is running.

* Make sure Postgres is running.


=== My home page redirects to some page that I didn't expect  ===

If your home page redirects to "localhost.localdomain" or some other
machine name that you didn't expect, you probably didn't specify
the hostname at configuration time, and ./configure couldn't correctly
figure it out.  Rerun ./configure with a fully-qualified hostname:

    $ ./configure --hostname=hostname.example.com

Then, rerun "make" and "make install".

"make install" will not overwrite the existing socialtext.conf file,
so you'll need to either delete the /etc/socialtext/socialtext.conf
before rerunning "make install", or manually update it yourself to
have web_hostname and email_hostname set to fully-qualified hostnames:

    email_hostname: hostname.example.com
    web_hostname: hostname.example.com


== database "NLW_yourname_testing" does not exist

To run the test suite, Socialtext needs a scratch database to work
in.  See docs/INSTALL.postgres for details on creating this database.


== dev-bin/create-db-user can't locate Socialtext/AppConfig.pm ==

If you're doing a make install, and this happens:

    $ sudo make install
    [ ! -e /etc/dont-install-nlw-here ]
    rm -f -R /usr/share/nlw 
    rm -f -R /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.5/{Public,Control,Socialtext}
    sudo -u postgres /usr/bin/perl dev-bin/create-db-user
    Can't locate Socialtext/AppConfig.pm in @INC (@INC contains:
    /home/andy/socialtext/dev-bin/../lib .... long list of directories ....

it's because your postgres user doesn't have read permissions to
the directory you've built Socialtext into.  Make sure that it's
world-readable.
