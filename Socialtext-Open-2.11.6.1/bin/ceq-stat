=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<ceq-stat>

=head1 OPTIONS

    --help      This help page
    --man       Manual page

 Changes in queue:
   Attachment  1
   Page        5

L<celqlotron(1)>, L<ceq-read(1)>

=head1 BUGS

ceq-stat does not lock the job queue directory when scanning for jobs, so occasionally, it
will try and report on a job that disappears out from underneath as it completes processing.
This is known and is done to keep looking at the queue from impacting performance of 
processing the queue.
