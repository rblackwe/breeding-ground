To set up a Test.Base based test suite, do the following steps:

1) Copy this directory from the Test.Base distribution to your project
   and rename it `tests` (a JSAN standard)
2) Rename `./Test/Sample.js` to your own local project test file. This
   is where you put any code that overrides or extends Test.Base.js
3) Edit the config.yaml file to your own values.
4) Write a bunch of test files with names like `foo.t.js` and
   `bar.t.js`.
5) Run: `cd run; make clean; make`
6) Point your browser at `http://your.domain/Your-Project/tests/run/index.html`
