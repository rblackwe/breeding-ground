You're now ready to use your workspace! Now, think about how you want to use it for you and your workgroup, and start creating and editing pages.

To start, you might want to create a personal page for yourself. Just visit the dashboard and click the *New Page* button. Or, you can start with any other page you'd like.

For more ideas, check out the collection of "Best Practices"<http://www.socialtext.net/exchange/index.cgi?best_practices> over at the "Socialtext Customer Exchange"<http://www.socialtext.net/exchange/>.

Enjoy!
