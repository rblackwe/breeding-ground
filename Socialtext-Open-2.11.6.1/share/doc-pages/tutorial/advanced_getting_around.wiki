Here are some more advanced workspace navigation techniques. If you like, you can go back to the basic page, called [How do I find my way around?]

You can use tags to group pages that are related. Anyone can put a tag on a page by clicking the *Add tag* button in the sidebar. You can find pages with a given tag by clicking the tag if it appears in the sidebar, or by going to the dashboard, then clicking on the *"All tags"* link.
