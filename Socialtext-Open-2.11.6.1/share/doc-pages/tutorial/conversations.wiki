Here's an example of what a conversation page might look like...

| ^^^ Group-forming metrics

[Adina] - I spoke this afternoon to Anil Gupta over at CyberProteins, Inc. They are interested in the groupforming metrics reports, and are interested in additional metrics about network growth.

[Ed] - It would also be useful to configure these reports more rapidly in the field. We should also consider think about providing services helping customers to choose and implement the right metrics. I'll bring this up at the next business-plan meeting. |
