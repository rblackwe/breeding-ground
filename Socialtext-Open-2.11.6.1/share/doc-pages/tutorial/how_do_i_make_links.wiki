Making links in Socialtext is very simple.

To add a link to a page in the workspace, first *double-click* to enter editing mode. Alternatively, click the *Edit* button.

Type the name of the page you want to link to, and turn it into a link simply by selecting it and clicking on http:base/images/wikiwyg_icons/link.gif in the toolbar.

If you make a link to a page that doesn't exist yet, your link will appear with a dotted underline. When you click on the link, the page will be created.
