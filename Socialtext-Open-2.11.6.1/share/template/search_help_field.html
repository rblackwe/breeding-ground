<p>
  It looks like you are trying to search on a field in the search index.
  At this time the fields available are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>title</li>
  <li>category</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You may search on a field by separating the field name from the
  query with a colon, like this:
</p>

<pre>
   title:hello
   category:help
</pre>

<p>
  If you try to search on a field that does not exist (<tt>link:hello</tt>)
  or without a query (<tt>link:</tt>) you will see this message.
</p>

<p>
  Your query was "[% self.cgi.search_term %]".
</p>

<p>
  As we continue to develop the search system, the options you will
  have and the interface you have to make use of them will improve.
