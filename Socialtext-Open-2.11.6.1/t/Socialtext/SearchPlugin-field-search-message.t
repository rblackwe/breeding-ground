# TODO: these DATA tests fail with KinoSearch because the Kino plugin isn't
# doing any validation on query strings for valid fields.  It's unclear to Matthew
# and JJP as to why this 'feature' exists.  JJP is going to follow up with
# Chris and Ken on this to see whether this feature of the query language is actually
# desired.
