Diner
 
The time has come to say goodbye, our plates empty except for our greasy
napkins. Comrades, you on my left, balding, middle-aged guy with a ponytail,
and you, Lefty there on my right, though we barely spoke I feel our kinship.
You were steadfast in passing the ketchup, the salt and pepper, no man could
ask for better companions. Lunch is over, the cheeseburgers and fries, the
Denver sandwich, the counter nearly empty. Now we must go our separate ways.
Not a fond embrace, but perhaps a hearty handshake. No? Well then, farewell.
It is unlikely I'll pass this way again. Unlikely we will ever meet again on
this earth, to sit together beneath the neon and fluorescent calmly sipping
our coffee, like the sages sipping their tea underneath the willow, sitting
quietly, saying nothing.
