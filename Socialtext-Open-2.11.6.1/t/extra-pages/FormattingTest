^^ Phrases

This paragraph contains content which is *bold*. It also has _italic_ content.
And for fun we've got *_bold italic_*. And lest we forget, there's always
-strike through-

And then there are* cases *where bolding shouldn't happen. There are times
when --> you don't expect --> strikethrough, but it happens.

Go to <http://foo.com/>.

*yo*. /yo/ . yo

This is *bold* _italic_ -strike- `monospace` yo

Leave `*stars*` and `_unders_` alone inside my backticks please.

^^ Tables

^^ Non WAFL

This is {not-wafl: really no} yo I say {nonono} {no go} eval {this_func()}

.not-a-wafl-block

^^ {rt: 14913}

Preserve pairs of angle brackets:
<h1>

<>
<.>

<<<>

^^ {rt: 14914}

Make wafl phrase markup stricter:

This {link[not]} {link,nope} {not.wafl.either}

Real wafl {{ {link:foo} or {link: foo} or {link foo} or {tm};}} only

^^ {rt: 14915}

Preserve lines of phrase markers (10 each below):

xxx **********
