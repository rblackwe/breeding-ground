# These modules are optional.  They are only for development, as they are for
# dev-only features (Apache::Reload), or only used in a few .t files.
#
# If it's not worth it to make someone install a module only to run a
# test or two, then put it in here.  If it's a test module that's used in
# many .t files, then put it in the main Deps.yaml file.
#
# If your code doesn't require a specific minimum version of a module,
# list "0" as the version.  Please do NOT include a non-zero version number
# unless one is actually required.  It will be a false dependency, and we
# will make people upgrade modules that they don't need to.
